/**
 * ollow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
What if duplicates are allowed?

Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Solution:
For case where AL == AM == AR, the minimum could be on AMâ€™s left or right side
(eg, [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] or [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]). 
In this case, we could not discard either subarrays
and therefore such worst case degenerates to the order of O(n).
